			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Using the New York Census Data we will construct predictive models for median household income and income per capita in NYC. The following outlines the procedure we took to construct our models.  Following and overview of our findings is a detailed description of our model creation with R code and interactive data visualizations.</p>
			
            <h3>Data Preview & Cleaning</h3>
			<p>The dimensions for the New York Census Dataset are 2167 by 36, which indicates that there are 36 features and 2167 entries in total. We start by splitting the data into two versions: one to create an "Income" model and another for an "Income Per Capita" model. For the income dataset, we remove the unnecessary columns "Borough", "IncomeErr", "IncomePerCap", and "IncomePerCapErr", which does not help us predict the median income. For the income per capita dataset, we do the same thing but keep the "IncomePerCap" instead of "Income."  We then omit all the N/A data. After that, we remove the columns of "County", "White", "Men", "PrivateWork", "Professional", and "Transit" because they are not quite related to our target "Median Household Income" and "Income Per Capita" and they are repetitive due to high correlation as well. At time point, we have two clean datasets from which to base our models. The dataset used for modeling Median Household Income has dimensions of 2095 by 26. The dataset used for modeling Income Per Capita has dimensions 2100 by 26.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
			<p>Feature Correlation Check<br>
Feature Selection -  Stepwise<br>
Cross-Validation - MSE<br>
Transformation - Log<br>
Ridge Regression<br>
Lasso Regression</p>

            <h3>Findings</h3>
			<p>After all, we come up with the best models for Median Household Income and Income Per Capita. 

With Lasso Regression, we get a model for income containing 14 variables: "Hispanic", "Black", "Citizen", "logPoverty", "logService", "Office", "logConstruction", "logProduction", "Drive", "logWalk", "OtherTransp", "WorkAtHome", "Employed" and "logPublicWork". The lowest MSE is 154777322. 

With Lasso Regression, we get a model for income per capital containing 13 variables: "Asian", "logPoverty", "logService", "Office", "logConstruction", "logProduction", "Carpool", "Walk", "OtherTransp", "WorkAtHome", "logMeanCommute", "Employed" and "logPublicWork". The lowest MSE is 120754522. 

When comparing the two models, "logPoverty", "logService", "logConstruction", "logProduction", "OtherTransp", "WorkAtHome", "Employed" and "logPublicWork" influence both models; they all have large coefficients which means they will significantly affect the result.</p>

            <p>The model above was instrumental in identifying which predictors most strongly influenced both income per capita and median household income predictions.  Once the strongest predictors were identified it was helpful to visualize the distribution of the data with interactive maps below.  The maps below are interactive.  You can zoom in closely to areas of interest and click specific census tracts for further details.</p>
